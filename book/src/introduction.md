# Introduction

Lace is an [*intuitive*](#) machine learning engine that **allows users to learn about their data** quickly by eliminating the post-training cost of asking answering questions. Lace facilitates the following machine learning capabilities

- Structure learning
- Row similarity / record relevance
- Likelihood computation
- Synthetic data and Simulation
- Imputation
- Prediction
- Uncertainty quantification
- Anomaly detection

Under the hood, Lace is a Probabilistic Cross-Categorization (PCC) engine. PCC is a Bayesian probabilistic model which learns a probability distribution over entire datasets.
